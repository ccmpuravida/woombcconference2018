                                A native of Louisville, Kentucky, USA, Fr. Dismas entered the community of the Franciscans of the renewal on September 8, 2004.
                                After the first two and a half years of his initial formation in New York, Fray Dismas was assigned to the friary, San Serafin in Comayagua, Honduras. In Comayagua, he worked three years in the "catechesis of the good Shepherd" with poor children from the Friars' neighborhood.<br /><br />
                                In 2010, he was reassigned to the friary of San Antonio in Matagalpa, Nicaragua where he worked in the friars' apostolates to the sick and the imprisoned, and where he also helped to introduce a new chastity ministry, aimed at young people, called Corazón Puro (Pure Hearth). Two years later he returned to New York to begin his studies for the priesthood. He was ordained a priest on May 28, 2016, and the following month returned to Matagalpa to begin his first assignment as a priest.
                                Upon arrival, he returned to his work with prisoners, the sick, and young people, in addition to receiving the responsibility of starting a new apostolate in Natural Family Planning for the Diocese.<br /><br />
                                In January of 2017, he received the Basic training for instructors offered by WOOMB Latin America along with 20 lay Nicaraguans from the Diocese of Matagalpa. In February of the same year the newly-opened apostolate MOBiN (Ovulation Method Billings&reg; of Nicaragua) received its approval for affiliation to WOOMB Int.

                                Marie Marshell  has a strong interest in the spread of authentic training and materials, developed through her experience working with the Drs Billings through a decade of trips to China as the lead Billings Ovulation Method&reg; trainer.
                                This led to an enriched and expanded teaching system and formed the basis for the curricula for training now used internationally. With Marian Corkill she has travelled extensively training and up skilling teachers throughout the world.<br /><br />
                                She is a member of the Education Committee and was the Study Leader for the Study on the Billings Ovulation Method&reg; and the Achievement of Pregnancy.
